# Leetcode

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 


Initialize two-pointers and start traversing the 
Move the slow pointer by one position.
Move the fast pointer by two positions.
If both pointers meet at some point then a loop exists and if the fast pointer meets the end position then no loop exists.


class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow=0;
        int fast=0;    
    while(x){
        if(fast>(nums.length-1)){
           fast=fast-(nums.length);
        }
        if(slow>(nums.length-1)){
           slow=slow-(nums.length-1);
    }   
        if((slow!=fast) && (nums[slow]==nums[fast])){
            break;
        }
        else{
            slow++;
            fast++;
            fast++;
        }
    }
    return nums[slow];
    }
}
